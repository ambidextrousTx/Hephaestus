Hephaestus: A comprehensive PageRank package in C++

Implements the naive and the more efficient version of PageRank according to Taher Haveliwala's paper Efficient Computing of PageRank. Takes an adjacency matrix, a bias vector, and certain booleans and computes the PageRank score for all vertices in the graph using either the fixed iteration method or the threshold method.

Files: main.cpp, Hephaestus.h, HephHelperFuncs.h, and HephIncludes.h
Format for the adjacency matrix file: row by row matrix [weighted or unweighted]
Format for the bias vector file: single line, values separated by space

Compile with g++ main.cpp -o main, run with ./main
